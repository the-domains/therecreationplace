If you would like a tour of the facility please stop by during operating hours. Our staff will be happy to show you around.

As a non-profit, our member rates are determined on a break-even basis for the facility (i.e., we only charge as much is needed to keep the facility running).  We try to build programs and classes at The Recreation Place based on the interests of our members.  As such, we love to hear ideas and recommendations from our members to help us continue to build on our services.  If you would like to give us some feedback, feel free to stop by the office of our Director, Cade Womack or email him at:
