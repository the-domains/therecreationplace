As a non-profit, our member rates are determined on a break-even basis for the facility (i.e., we only charge as much is needed to keep the facility running). We try to build programs and classes at The Recreation Place based on the interests of our members. As such, we love to hear ideas and recommendations from our members to help us continue to build on our services.
